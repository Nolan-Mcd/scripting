		<p>Lethbridge is a beautiful city split into two, having three bridges which allow passing between the two parts of town for cars and trains alike.  This city is often known for its winds and warm sunshine as its location being in the prairies creates some amazing sunrises and sunsets. If I were to pick a favourite place in town, it’d have to be Henderson Lake. The place is beautiful, having a nice path to walk around and some bridges to stop at to look towards the Japanese Garden nearby. It’s just a nice place to walk around and the various sights just make for a calming experience to walk around, whether alone, or with others.</p>
