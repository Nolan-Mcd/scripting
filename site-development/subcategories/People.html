		<p>Due to being close to the Blood Tribe also known as Kainai Nation, the city is very diverse in population, whether it’s in terms of race, gender or age. Lots of people come to Lethbridge to study in the two post-secondary facilities here, being Lethbridge College and the University of Lethbridge. Which is why most of the population grows within the fall, as students will come to Lethbridge in pursuit of their careers. There are also a good amount of elderly people or people that are nearing retirement in the city, which creates a healthy diversity between young and old here. Based on personal experience, the population here is very kind and welcoming towards people new to this community that’s been built up over the past 115 years.</p>
