		<p>Looking into what there is to do here, there is a plethora of attractions to visit or participate in here. There’s the Nikka Yuko Japanese Garden by Henderson Lake Park, both of which have beautiful views for walking through, the garden is a great place to have a nice and authentic tea ceremony that you can book a time to participate in. At the end of the summers, we often have a huge festival called Whoop-Up Days to celebrate the community spirit of the city. It makes for a fun time with friends, I’ve gone there a few times through the past few years and really enjoyed it. Though the most fun I’ve had in town was at The Canadian Brewhouse, it was really nice to spend some time there with both friends and family after all that’s been happening over the past couple years.</p>
