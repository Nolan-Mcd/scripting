		<p>The city of Lethbridge is split into two by a river which heads down the middle, keeping two bridges for roads and the High-Level Bridge for trains. Because of such, it splits the west side of town from the northern and southern side, both sides being much higher than the Old Man River at the bottom. There is a plethora of trails available throughout the coulees, allowing people to enjoy walks, runs, or bike rides as they navigate around town.  The city is surrounded by plenty of plains, making agricultural work very easy and accessible here. Not too far west from Lethbridge is Waterton National Park, which is a huge place for tourism, so itâ€™s common that people from the east will pass through or stay here to get there.</p>
